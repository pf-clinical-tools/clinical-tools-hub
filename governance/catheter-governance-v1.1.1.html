      <h2>1. Background and Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        Urinary catheterisation and trial without catheter (TWOC) are common interventions in patients admitted with
        femoral and pelvic fractures, particularly in the peri-operative period. However, practice is highly variable,
        and inappropriate catheter use is associated with well-recognised harms, including catheter-associated urinary
        tract infection (CAUTI), delirium, reduced mobility, delayed rehabilitation, and patient discomfort and distress.<sup>1,2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, delayed recognition of clinically significant urinary retention can result in bladder over-distension,
        acute kidney injury, hydronephrosis, and prolonged catheter dependence.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Older and frail trauma patients present particular challenges because symptoms of urinary retention are often unreliable;
        pain, immobility, delirium, and opioid use blunt symptom reporting; and physiological reserve is limited.<sup>4,5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        This creates a need for structured, conservative, volume-based decision support that can be applied consistently by nursing staff
        while preserving escalation pathways and clinical judgement.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Purpose of the Tool</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this tool is to support safe, auditable nursing decision-making regarding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>when catheterisation is indicated,</li>
        <li>when catheterisation should be avoided,</li>
        <li>when TWOC may be attempted, and</li>
        <li>how TWOC outcomes should be interpreted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The tool does not replace local policy, senior clinical judgement, or urological advice. It functions as a decision-support aid
        rather than a prescriptive protocol.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Development Methodology</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Evidence sources</h3>
      <p>The logic and thresholds used in the tool were derived from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UK and international guidelines on catheter use and urinary retention,<sup>6–9</sup></li>
        <li>urological and orthogeriatric consensus statements and reviews,<sup>10,11</sup></li>
        <li>observational studies examining bladder volume thresholds and TWOC outcomes,<sup>12–14</sup></li>
        <li>pragmatic standards commonly embedded in NHS nursing standard operating procedures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No single guideline provides a fully specified algorithm for peri-operative catheter management in hip fracture patients.
        The tool therefore synthesises convergent practice standards rather than extrapolating from a single source.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Design philosophy</h3>
      <p><strong>Bladder volume over symptoms</strong><br>
        Objective bladder volume is prioritised over subjective symptoms, particularly in frail or cognitively impaired patients.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Conservative thresholds</strong><br>
        Thresholds are chosen to minimise harm from bladder over-distension rather than to maximise catheter avoidance.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Explicit STOP and escalation rules</strong><br>
        Situations where catheterisation should not proceed without senior input are clearly identified.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Auditability</strong><br>
        Each output is accompanied by an explicit rationale suitable for contemporaneous documentation.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Evidence Underpinning Catheterisation Decisions</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Why bladder volume is central</h3>
      <p>
        Symptoms of urinary retention are poorly sensitive in older adults. Clinically significant retention may be present without pain
        or distress, particularly in patients with delirium, immobility, or neurological impairment.<sup>4,12</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bladder scanning provides a non-invasive and reproducible measure and is therefore widely recommended to guide decision-making.<sup>6,7</sup>
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Symptomatic retention (≥300 mL)</h3>
      <p>
        A post-void residual (PVR) or bladder volume of ≥300 mL is commonly cited as indicating inadequate bladder emptying and clinically
        relevant retention.<sup>12,13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple sources support catheterisation when symptoms of retention are present and bladder volume is ≥300 mL. Volumes below this threshold
        are less consistently associated with harm and warrant reassessment rather than immediate catheterisation.<sup>13</sup>
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Asymptomatic retention (≥500 mL)</h3>
      <p>
        In asymptomatic patients, higher thresholds are recommended to avoid unnecessary catheterisation. Observational data associate bladder volumes
        ≥500 mL with increased risk of over-distension and renal sequelae.<sup>3,14</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, the tool recommends observation and repeat scanning at 300–499 mL and catheterisation at ≥500 mL in the absence of symptoms.
        This aligns with conservative nursing practice and urological consensus.<sup>8,10</sup>
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Overriding clinical indications</h3>
      <p>
        Certain clinical states warrant deviation from standard volume thresholds, including acute kidney injury, hydronephrosis, or rapidly rising
        bladder volumes. These reflect organ-level risk where delay may result in harm.<sup>3,9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool therefore permits senior-led override of standard prerequisites in these circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Evidence Underpinning TWOC Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Successful TWOC depends not only on bladder physiology but also on contextual safety factors, including haemodynamic stability, pain control,
        availability of bladder scanning, and adequate staffing and mobility support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guidance emphasises that TWOC should be attempted only when monitoring and re-intervention are feasible.<sup>6,7</sup>
        The eligibility checklist reflects these principles and is designed to prevent unsafe or poorly supported TWOC attempts.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Evidence Underpinning TWOC Outcome Interpretation</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Primary role of post-void bladder volume</h3>
      <p>
        Post-void residual volume is the most reliable indicator of TWOC success or failure.<sup>12,14</sup>
        Evidence supports PVR &lt;200 mL as compatible with successful voiding and PVR ≥300 mL as indicating failed TWOC.<sup>12–14</sup>
        Intermediate values (200–299 mL) represent an uncertainty zone and warrant observation rather than immediate re-catheterisation.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Role of symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        Symptoms such as discomfort or distress increase concern but do not override objective volume thresholds. In frail patients, symptoms may be absent
        despite significant retention or present despite minimal residual volume.<sup>4,12</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool therefore uses symptoms to modify urgency rather than redefine success or failure.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Safety, Risk, and Escalation</h2>
      <p>
        The tool embeds safety features including prohibition of catheterisation without senior input in suspected urethral injury or macroscopic haematuria,
        STOP rules for pain, resistance, or patient instability, and limits on repeated intermittent catheterisation. These reflect catheter safety guidance and
        aim to reduce iatrogenic harm.<sup>8,10</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitations and Uncertainty</h2>
      <p>
        The evidence base for catheter management in hip fracture and pelvic trauma patients is limited. Most thresholds derive from mixed medical and surgical
        populations rather than trauma-specific trials. Accordingly, thresholds are pragmatic rather than definitive, clinical judgement remains essential, and
        escalation is encouraged when outputs do not fit the clinical picture. The tool is intentionally conservative to mitigate risk in a vulnerable population.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Governance Position</h2>
      <p>
        This tool supports standardisation of good practice, facilitates audit and documentation, and does not mandate decisions or override policy. It is suitable
        for use within local clinical governance frameworks and should be reviewed if new national guidance emerges.
